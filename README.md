# Keycode Generator

## About the project

This was the first solo project I completed as part of the 12-week immersive coding bootcamp with Code Nation.

We were given a brief to create a keycode generator that would be able to tell the user the associated keycode and key whenever the user taps a key on their keyboard.

We were also given designs for both desktop and mobile in order to create a fully responsive app.

### Built with

- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- HTML
